        <div class="line2"></div>
        <p class="aboutP">Hi, Welcome to my website. My name is Justin Gravely. For the greater portion of my life I
          have been an obese to morbidly obese NEET (an acronym meaning, 'Not in Education, Employment, or Training')
          with little social skill, world experience, moderate to severe depression, and crippling social anxiety
          coupled with panic disorder related to cardiovascular health concerns. I've only ever held down a single job
          and it was part time. I'm 25.<br><br>

          "Wow! What an introduction!", I know it's harsh and it's not pretty but I'd like to lay it all out so you get
          a real portrait of who I'm and where I'm coming from. <br><br>

          Most of my youth to current years have been spent trying to find meaning and fullfillment in video games. Even
          in the more recent years after an important event that changed my life I still found myself making excuses
          like, "I'm spending so much time looking for a good video game to play or things to do in this game because I
          just really really need to have something great lined up for my downtime after studying!".
          <br><br>
          This site is where I will blog my progress in every important aspect of my life and it also houses my work
          portfolio.
          <br><br>
          So where do I get my hope from coming from that life and now being 25 with nothing to show? How am I not
          depressed? How did I beat panic disorder? How did I lose the weight? How do I push through any leftover
          anxiety that tries to hold me back?
          Well, I'll tell you. As you can see above, in the hero banner including my logo, name, and title, it says,
          "Justin Gravely, Javascript Dev & Designer", but really it should read, "Justin Gravely, Child of God,
          Javascript Dev & Designer". <br><br>

          Ever since I opened myself up to the possibility of God existing after wanting to understand the faith,
          happiness and kindness these so-called Christians had on an otherwise dark forum on the internet my mental
          state slowly but surely started turning around for the better. Yes, it was the most important moment of my
          life when I put my faith in Jesus, but looking back I can see God began helping me when I just WANTED to
          believe in Him at all but couldn't yet. <br><br>God's teachings and instruction on how to live coupled with
          the faith, love, and hope he freely gives is the ONLY pillar I stand on. He gets all the credit for my life,
          wherever it ends up going, whatever I achieve, whomever I help, without him the I that I am in these times
          wouldn't exist.
